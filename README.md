## Overview
Welcome to the OSF repository for the paper titled "The risk is in the eye of the beholder: Risk preferences and attention in finance." This repository contains all the necessary data and scripts to reproduce the analysis presented in the paper.

## Abstract
This work explores the relationship between risk preferences and decision-making in financial contexts using a novel methodological approach involving eyes- and mouse-tracking. The experimental design separates attention and decision phases and examines how risk preferences influence each phase. Results indicate that risk aversion significantly influences attentional behavior, directing focus to risk-relevant information faster and more intensely. However, mouse-tracking dynamics did not reveal clear differences in decision-making processes across risk preferences, suggesting a complex interplay. This chapter contributes to the financial decision-making literature by highlighting the role of embodied experience in shaping risk preferences and refining experimental approaches to understanding decision-making processes.
